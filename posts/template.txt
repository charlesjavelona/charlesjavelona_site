---------------------------------------------

STEP 1: The Contrarian Hook (1-2 paragraphs)
Write your opening by answering these questions:

What assumption about intelligence/education does everyone hold?
How can you flip that assumption with a provocative question?
What uncomfortable truth are you about to reveal?

Your task: Draft 2-3 sentences that make readers question their basic assumptions

Common assumption - Sentence 1: 
Elite education promises to impart critical thinking, and we blindly assume graduates are immune to manipulation after they graduate.

Build on that assumption - Sentence 2 & 3
Yet highly educated professionals today fall for charismatic leaders promising optimization, meaning, or insider knowledge despite access to democratized knowlede and information.

The Flip - provacative question and claim - Senteence 4:
What if the very traits universities cultivate—analytical confidence, pattern recognition, belief in meritocracy—make graduates perfect targets for sophisticated manipulation?"


Elite education promises to impart critical thinking, and we blindly assume graduates are immune to manipulation. Yet highly educated professionals today fall for charismatic leaders promising optimization, meaning, or insider knowledge despite access to democratized knowledge and information.
What if the very traits universities cultivate — analytical confidence, pattern recognition, belief in meritocracy — make graduates perfect targets for sophisticated manipulation?

STEP 2: Define Your Terms (1 paragraph)
Answer precisely:

What exactly do you mean by "smart people"?
How do you define "cult-like groups" vs actual cults?
Why are these distinctions important?
Your task: Write clear definitions that prevent readers from dismissing your argument


What does cult-like-groups mean? First - lets define what are cult like characterisitcs with two 
The following traits in a group would be: 
- containing charismatic, unquestionable leaders
- us vs them mentality
- progressive isolation from outside influences
- financial/time exploitation
- punishment for questioning
- promise of exclusive truth/salvation


Cult-like-groups are organizations that use pyschological techniques such as social proof, exclusive access, and gradual commitment escalation to recruit smart members, then systematically control their behaviour, information sources, and manipulate their emotions to maintain commitment.
Smart people means they are college educated professionals - engineers, doctors, lawyers, executives that are high achievers - who confidently believe their intelligence are immune against modern manipulation.
The real danger that one should look out for is the recruitment phase. By the time people recognize the control tactics, psychological commitment has already been established.


STEP 3: Present Your Core Thesis (1 paragraph)
Complete this sentence in your own words:
"Intelligence makes people vulnerable to cult-like groups because..."
Your task: State your main argument clearly and boldly
STEP 4: The Evidence Section (2-3 paragraphs)
For each paragraph, pick one category:

Historical examples (20th century intellectuals)
Recent examples (NXIVM, QAnon professionals)
Psychological mechanisms (rationalization, pattern-seeking)

Your task: Choose your strongest evidence and explain why it supports your thesis
