STEP 1: The Contrarian Hook (1-2 paragraphs)
Write your opening by answering these questions:

What assumption about intelligence/education does everyone hold?
How can you flip that assumption with a provocative question?
What uncomfortable truth are you about to reveal?

Your task: Draft 2-3 sentences that make readers question their basic assumptions

Common assumption - Sentence 1: 
Elite education promises to impart critical thinking, and we blindly assume graduates are immune to manipulation after they graduate.

Build on that assumption - Sentence 2 & 3
Yet highly educated professionals today fall for charismatic leaders promising optimization, meaning, or insider knowledge despite access to democratized knowlede and information.

The Flip - provacative question and claim - Senteence 4:
What if the very traits universities cultivate—analytical confidence, pattern recognition, belief in meritocracy—make graduates perfect targets for sophisticated manipulation?"

STEP 2: Define Your Terms (1 paragraph)
Answer precisely:

What exactly do you mean by "smart people"?
How do you define "cult-like groups" vs actual cults?
Why are these distinctions important?

Your task: Write clear definitions that prevent readers from dismissing your argument
STEP 3: Present Your Core Thesis (1 paragraph)
Complete this sentence in your own words:
"Intelligence makes people vulnerable to cult-like groups because..."
Your task: State your main argument clearly and boldly
STEP 4: The Evidence Section (2-3 paragraphs)
For each paragraph, pick one category:

Historical examples (20th century intellectuals)
Recent examples (NXIVM, QAnon professionals)
Psychological mechanisms (rationalization, pattern-seeking)

Your task: Choose your strongest evidence and explain why it supports your thesis
